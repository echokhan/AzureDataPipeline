## Weather Data

## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end ETL pipeline to ingest, process, and store weather data from multiple sources (REST API and CSV file) into a cloud-based data warehouse, making it ready for visualization. This pipeline is designed to handle both real-time and batch processing, with orchestration and monitoring capabilities for robust, scalable data processing.
